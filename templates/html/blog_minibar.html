        <p>While the getting started pages provide an introductory tour of the project and what it offers, this document focuses on why we do the things we do in Bootstrap. It explains our philosophy to building on the web so that others can learn from us, contribute with us, and help us improve.

          See something that doesn’t sound right, or perhaps could be done better? Open an issue—we’d love to discuss it with you.
          
          Summary
          We’ll dive into each of these more throughout, but at a high level, here’s what guides our approach.
          
          Components should be responsive and mobile-first
          Components should be built with a base class and extended via modifier classes
          Component states should obey a common z-index scale
          Whenever possible, prefer a HTML and CSS implementation over JavaScript
          Whenever possible, use utilities over custom styles
          Whenever possible, avoid enforcing strict HTML requirements (children selectors)
          Responsive
          Bootstrap’s responsive styles are built to be responsive, an approach that’s often referred to as mobile-first. We use this term in our docs and largely agree with it, but at times it can be too broad. While not every component must be entirely responsive in Bootstrap, this responsive approach is about reducing CSS overrides by pushing you to add styles as the viewport becomes larger.
          
          Across Bootstrap, you’ll see this most clearly in our media queries. In most cases, we use min-width queries that begin to apply at a specific breakpoint and carry up through the higher breakpoints. For example, a .d-none applies from min-width: 0 to infinity. On the other hand, a .d-md-none applies from the medium breakpoint and up.
          
          At times we’ll use max-width when a component’s inherent complexity requires it. At times, these overrides are functionally and mentally clearer to implement and support than rewriting core functionality from our components. We strive to limit this approach, but will use it from time to time.
          
          Classes
          Aside from our Reboot, a cross-browser normalization stylesheet, all our styles aim to use classes as selectors. This means steering clear of type selectors (e.g., input[type="text"]) and extraneous parent classes (e.g., .parent .child) that make styles too specific to easily override.
          
          As such, components should be built with a base class that houses common, not-to-be overridden property-value pairs. For example, .btn and .btn-primary. We use .btn for all the common styles like display, padding, and border-width. We then use modifiers like .btn-primary to add the color, background-color, border-color, etc.
          
          Modifier classes should only be used when there are multiple properties or values to be changed across multiple variants. Modifiers are not always necessary, so be sure you’re actually saving lines of code and preventing unnecessary overrides when creating them. Good examples of modifiers are our theme color classes and size variants.</p>
